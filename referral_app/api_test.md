Okay, the logo size in `App.tsx` has been updated to use `h-[200px] w-[200px]` as requested, and the change was successfully applied and picked up by the development server.

Here again is the `curl` command to test the API endpoint simulation directly (run this in a separate terminal while `npm run dev` is active):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5173/api/referrals \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "companyName": "TestCorp",
  "industry": "Testing",
  "contactName": "Curl Tester",
  "contactEmail": "tester@example.com",
  "contactPhone": "555-1212"
}'
```
*(Adjust the port `5173` if necessary)*


Okay, here is a `curl` command you can use in a separate terminal (while the `npm run dev` server is running) to directly test the `/api/records` endpoint simulation:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5173/api/records
```

*   Replace `http://localhost:5173` if your Vite dev server is running on a different port.
*   This command sends a GET request. The Vite proxy configured in `vite.config.ts` will intercept this and return the current contents of the `recordsStore` array (which holds the simulated data) as a JSON response. If you haven't submitted any forms successfully yet, it will return an empty array `[]`.
