Initial Checkpoint

Okay, I understand the requirements. The goal is to create a Python-based MCP server that exposes LightRAG's search capabilities (naive, local, global, hybrid) as distinct MCP tools using the SSE transport.
First, let's get the general instructions for creating an MCP server. This will provide the foundational structure and concepts needed.

Okay, I have the general instructions. Now, let's adapt them for a Python SSE server.
First, I need to find an example of a Python SSE server within the MCP Python SDK examples to understand the structure and required components.
Roo wants to view the top level files in this directory:
mcp_server/python-sdk/examples/servers‎
API Request
$0.0000
It seems those examples might be too basic or focused on Stdio. The instructions mentioned fastmcp within the Python SDK examples. Let's check there, as fastmcp likely refers to FastAPI, which is suitable for building SSE servers.

Okay, this example (lightrag_multi_model_all_modes_demo.py) clearly shows how to initialize LightRAG and perform queries using different modes (naive, local, global, hybrid) by passing a QueryParam object to the rag.query() method. It also demonstrates loading data using rag.insert().
Before writing the server code, let's confirm if the book.txt file used in the example exists in that directory.

Okay, book.txt is not present in the examples directory. This means the server cannot pre-load data from that specific file.
Therefore, we need to add a mechanism for the user to insert data into the LightRAG instance before performing searches. A dedicated MCP tool for data insertion seems appropriate.
Here's the plan:
Create a Python file named lightrag_mcp_server.py in the mcp_server directory.
Use FastMCP to create the server foundation.
Implement an asynchronous function to initialize the LightRAG instance. This function will set up the working directory, embedding function, and LLM model, similar to the example. We'll use FastAPI's lifespan events to run this initialization when the server starts.
Create an insert_data tool that accepts text content and uses rag.insert() to add it to the LightRAG knowledge base.
Create the four search tools (naive_search, local_search, global_search, hybrid_search). Each tool will accept a query_text parameter and call rag.query() with the corresponding mode.
Ensure necessary environment variables (like OPENAI_API_KEY) are handled, as LightRAG requires them for OpenAI models/embeddings. We'll configure this later in the mcp_settings.json.
Let's write the initial code for mcp_server/lightrag_mcp_server.py.
Roo wants to create a new file:
mcp_server/lightrag_mcp_server.py‎

Checkpoint
Okay, the server code mcp_server/lightrag_mcp_server.py has been created.
Next, I need your OpenAI API key to configure the server, as it uses OpenAI models for embeddings and generation within LightRAG. The server will read this key from its environment variables when it starts.
Roo has a question:
Please provide your OpenAI API key:
My OpenAI API key is sk-...
I don't have an OpenAI API key yet.
Where can I get an OpenAI API key?
My OpenAI API key is sk-...
API Request
$0.0000
Okay, I have the API key. Now I will add the configuration for the LightRAG SSE server to the MCP settings file.
This involves:
Reading the current settings file (/home/pop/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/mcp_settings.json).
Adding a new entry for the lightrag-server under mcpServers. This will be configured as a "Remote (SSE)" type, specifying the command to run the Uvicorn server and the URL it will listen on.
Including the OPENAI_API_KEY in the environment variables for the server process.
Writing the updated configuration back to the file.

First, let's read the existing settings file.
Roo wants to read this file outside of the workspace:
home/pop/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/mcp_settings.json‎ (max 500 lines)

API Request
$0.0000
Okay, the settings file is currently minimal. I will now add the configuration for the lightrag-server. I'll configure it as a local process that runs the Uvicorn server, providing the necessary command, arguments, and the OpenAI API key via environment variables.
Roo wants to edit this file outside of the workspace:
home/pop/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/mcp_settings.json‎

API Request
$0.0000
The MCP settings file has been updated. The system should now attempt to start the lightrag-server based on this configuration.
Once the server is running, you will see it listed under "Connected MCP Servers" in the environment details, along with its available tools: insert_data, naive_search, local_search, global_search, and hybrid_search.
Task Completed
I have created the LightRAG MCP server (mcp_server/lightrag_mcp_server.py) and configured it in your MCP settings.
The server provides the following tools:
insert_data: Adds text content to the LightRAG knowledge base.
naive_search: Performs a naive search.
local_search: Performs a search focused on local context.
global_search: Performs a search across the entire dataset.
hybrid_search: Performs a hybrid search combining local and global aspects.
You can now use these tools via the use_mcp_tool command. Remember to use insert_data first to load content before performing searches. For example:
Insert data:
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>lightrag-server</server_name>
<tool_name>insert_data</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "text_content": "Your text data goes here..."
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>


Perform a search:
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>lightrag-server</server_name>
<tool_name>naive_search</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "query_text": "Your search query here"
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
